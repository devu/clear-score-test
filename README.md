# Frontend Test

## Getting Started
This is based on your boilerplate so you already know how to:
 * Run: `yarn start:webpack`
 * Run: `yarn start:dev` _(in a new terminal)_
 * Goto: `http://localhost:3000/`

## The Task

Build our circular score indicator - done
It took me about 2h to fiddle around this. I've build a component with reusability in mind so the following task should be easy to do.
But at this point I'm commiting it to mark this as a 'milestone' ;)

## The AC's

Nope, because to be very accurate, use data correctly, structure it all, etc... this is not a 2h task. I did however build component with reusability in mind and utilised React life cycle methods to reset/restart sequence on demand. So that should be fairly eeasy.

### Stretch goal

It has been added, but I would like you to keep your mind open for the solution I've used. Sure I could go with a standard aproach something like this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NMmXJm ,
But I wanted to show you ability to think out of the box and provide solution that is easy to control and test as well.

### Unit test
Covered to demonstrate how easy is to unit test above solution

### Notes
Please keep in mind for a given time I wasn't concerned about crossbrowser compatibility and I am aware of IE issues with blured image not working correctly. Work arounds are known to cover IE 11+ but again, not in this time scale. Wanted to get something tengible first.
